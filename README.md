# First version of crowdfunding page

This is a minimalistic static site with crowdfunding information

## Local development

This site is built using only html, css and basic javascript. You don't need anything except a common browser to run it.

Open the index.html file in your browser to preview the site. Note that you will run into CORS errors locally unless you disable Cross-Origin Restrictions (CORS) in your browser.

Pushing to the `main` branch automatically deploys to github pages.
