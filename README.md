# First version of skogsvärn.se

This is a minimalistic static site with a short about section and an event lists based on a json file.

## Add / remove events

You can edit events directly in [this file](https://github.com/varnsida/hemsida-1/blob/main/data/events.json) using githubs graphical user interface for editing file. Just make sure to strictly follow the same (json) format.

## Local development

This site is built using only html, css and basic javascript. You don't anything except a common browser to run it.

Open the index.html file in your browser. Note that you will run into CORS errors unless you disable Cross-Origin Restrictions (CORS) in your browser.

Pushing to main branch automatically deploys to github pages and skogsvärn.se.
